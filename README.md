# Research-Available-Licenses
Research done for a subject about licensing in videogames
My name is Eric Abad Pellicer and I'm currently studying Video Games development and design at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC). For the Project 2 subject I was asked to do research work about Available Licenses, so it would help in our next projects and games.

I'm focusing in explaining the protection of an IP(intellectual property) and how licensing agreements work in the industry.

If you want to know more details about this topic, you can download a pdf file at my github (www.github.com/cireks/Research-Available-Licenses)
